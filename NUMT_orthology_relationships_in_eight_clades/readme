In the file 'Orthology assignment in the eight defined clade.xlsx', the content illustrates the information of NUMT orthology assignment between each species in the eight defined clades. In each sheet, the color code indicates that the NUMTs/NUMT blocks were predicted to be orthologous across the defined clades.


In the file 'Pairwise orthology assignments between species.xlsx', the content illustrates the number of orthologous NUMTs/NUMT blocks between each pair of speices.
